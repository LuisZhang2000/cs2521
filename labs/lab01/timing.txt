Patterns:

Average time for sort was always significantly shorter than average time for my own function (useIntList)
this is because of the efficiency of the two methods, sort is more efficient than the code I have written

If the values were originally sorted than it usually took less time to sort again

Input with 10000 values generally took longer to sort than input with 5000 values (obviously)

Duplicates and no duplicates were done on different computers so results may be inconsistent when comparing dups to non dups
